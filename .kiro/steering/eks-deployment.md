# EKS Deployment Guidelines

## Development Testing Workflow

When deploying to the EKS test cluster during development:

1. **Delete webhook configurations first** (they block CR edits when operator is down):
   ```bash
   kubectl delete validatingwebhookconfiguration kube-microvm-operator-validating --ignore-not-found
   kubectl delete mutatingwebhookconfiguration kube-microvm-operator-mutating --ignore-not-found
   ```

2. **Force-remove all custom resources** (finalizers block deletion without operator):
   ```bash
   # Patch out finalizers and delete
   for cr in microvmimages microvms microvmreplicasets microvmnetworks; do
     kubectl get $cr -A -o json 2>/dev/null | \
       python3 -c "import json,sys; items=json.load(sys.stdin).get('items',[]); [print(i['metadata']['namespace']+'/'+i['metadata']['name']) for i in items]" 2>/dev/null | \
       while read ns_name; do
         ns="${ns_name%%/*}"; name="${ns_name##*/}"
         kubectl patch $cr "$name" -n "$ns" --type=json -p='[{"op":"remove","path":"/metadata/finalizers"}]' 2>/dev/null
         kubectl delete $cr "$name" -n "$ns" --force 2>/dev/null
       done
   done
   ```

3. **Force-uninstall the Helm chart**:
   ```bash
   helm uninstall kube-microvm-operator -n kube-microvm --wait
   # Clean up cert-manager resources
   kubectl delete secret kube-microvm-operator-webhook-tls kube-microvm-operator-ca -n kube-microvm --ignore-not-found
   kubectl delete certificate,issuer --all -n kube-microvm --ignore-not-found
   ```

4. **Only then install the new chart** (never `helm upgrade` during dev iteration):
   ```bash
   helm install kube-microvm-operator <chart> -n kube-microvm \
     --set app.image=<ecr-image> \
     --set app.envs.AWS_REGION=us-east-1 \
     --set app.envs.AWS_MICROVM_ENDPOINT=https://lambda-microvm.us-east-1.on.aws \
     --timeout 4m --wait
   ```

4. **Always use `imagePullPolicy: Always`** to ensure the latest image is pulled,
   even when reusing the same tag (e.g. `0.0.1-rc1`). This is set in application.properties.

## Avoiding Blocked Operations

Any `kubectl delete` or `kubectl patch` that targets a CR with finalizers can block
indefinitely if the operator is not running or not watching that namespace.

**Always use `--timeout=30s` on delete operations:**

```bash
# Safe delete pattern — never blocks longer than 30s
kubectl delete microvm my-vm -n default --force --grace-period=0 --timeout=30s 2>/dev/null || true

# Safe finalizer removal + delete
kubectl patch microvm my-vm -n default \
  --type=json -p='[{"op":"remove","path":"/metadata/finalizers"}]' \
  --request-timeout=10s 2>/dev/null || true
kubectl delete microvm my-vm -n default --force --grace-period=0 --timeout=30s 2>/dev/null || true
```

**Rule**: All delete and patch operations in scripts, teardown steps, and
development workflows must include `--timeout=30s` (or `--request-timeout=10s`
for patch). Never issue a bare `kubectl delete` on a CR without a timeout.

## When to Delete the ValidatingWebhookConfiguration

**During operator redeployment only** — not during normal VM teardown.

The webhook has `FailurePolicy: Fail`. When the operator pod is down (between
`helm uninstall` and `helm install`), any CR admission request goes to the
webhook, gets no response, and fails. This blocks CR deletes and patches.

```
Normal VM teardown (operator running):
  → No need to delete webhook config
  → Set desiredState: Terminated → delete MicroVM → delete MicroVMImage

Operator redeployment (dev workflow):
  → Delete webhook configs first (operator going down)
  → Patch out finalizers + delete CRs
  → helm uninstall
  → helm install
```

## Namespace Watching

The operator watches **only namespaces labelled** with
`lambda.aws.amazon.com/manage-microvms=true`. This is enforced at the watch
level via JOSDK namespace label selector — unlabelled namespaces are completely
ignored (no finalizers, no reconciliation, no stuck-delete risk).

See `docs/design/namespace-watching.md` for full design.

**Label a namespace to enable MicroVMs:**
```bash
kubectl label namespace my-team lambda.aws.amazon.com/manage-microvms=true
```

**Remove management (stop watching):**
```bash
kubectl label namespace my-team lambda.aws.amazon.com/manage-microvms-
# Terminate all VMs in that namespace first!
```

**Default at install**: `default` namespace is labelled automatically by Helm.

**To restrict which namespaces the operator watches**, configure in
`application.properties`:

```properties
# Watch specific namespaces only (comma-separated)
quarkus.operator-sdk.namespaces=default,production,staging

# Or watch all (not recommended — use label selector instead)
quarkus.operator-sdk.namespaces=*
```

For multi-tenant clusters, restricting namespaces reduces the operator's blast
radius and limits the RBAC surface. For single-tenant or dev clusters, all-
namespace watching is fine.


- Custom resources with finalizers cannot be deleted without a running operator.
  Always patch out finalizers before uninstalling the chart.
- `helm upgrade` during development often leaves stale resources (old secrets, CRDs, finalizers)
  that conflict with the new deployment. Always uninstall + install.
- With a fixed tag like `0.0.1-rc1`, Kubernetes defaults to `IfNotPresent` and won't
  pull the updated image unless `imagePullPolicy: Always` is explicitly set.
- cert-manager Certificates and Secrets must be re-created when the issuer chain changes.

## VPC Endpoint Requirements

The operator running in private subnets requires these VPC endpoints:
- `com.amazonaws.<region>.eks-auth` — Pod Identity credential resolution
- `com.amazonaws.<region>.lambda-microvm` — Lambda MicroVMs API (private DNS: `lambda-microvm.<region>.on.aws`)
- `com.amazonaws.<region>.sts` — STS for credential validation
- `com.amazonaws.<region>.ecr.api` + `com.amazonaws.<region>.ecr.dkr` — image pulls
- `com.amazonaws.<region>.s3` (Gateway) — ECR layers + S3 code artifacts

The `aws.microvm.endpoint` config property overrides the SDK endpoint to use the VPC endpoint DNS.
